# causal_inference_with_OPTNs
In this repository, I have included the codes to implement causal inference method described in "Causal coupling inference from multivariate time series based on ordinal partition transition networks" (Nonlinear Dynamics, Springer).


I have included demo codes to run causal inference methods on simulated data generated with  1) stochastic system (MVAR model) and 2) network of neural mass models to reproduce some results. The MEA data used in the paper is uploaded in Zenodo (link here). 


The folder "func" contains all the codes that implement the method described in our paper.

The folder "external" contains codes from other toolboxes/authors to compute metrics like conditional entropy, mutual information etc
