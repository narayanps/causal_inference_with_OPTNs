%ENTROPY Compute the Shannon entropy of a set of variables.
%   ENTROPY(X,P) returns the (joint) entropy for the joint distribution 
%   corresponding to object matrix X and probability vector P.  Each row of
%   MxN matrix X is an N-dimensional object, and P is a length-M vector 
%   containing the corresponding probabilities.  Thus, the probability of 
%   object X(i,:) is P(i).  
%
%   ENTROPY(X), with no probability vector specified, will assume a uniform
%   distribution across the objects in X.
%   
%   If X contains duplicate rows, these are assumed to be occurrences of the 
%   same object, and the corresponding probabilities are added.  (This is 
%   actually the only reason that object matrix X is needed -- to detect and 
%   merge repeated objects.  Of course, the entropy itself only depends on 
%   the probability vector P.)  Matrix X need NOT be an exhaustive list of 
%   all *possible* objects in the universe; objects that do not appear in X
%   are simply assumed to have zero probability. 
%
%   The elements of probability vector P must sum to 1 +/- .00001.
